When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an additional 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.",
		"improvements": [

		"level": 3,
		"description": "At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror. If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia and fear into its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.",
		"additionalDetails": [
			"If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it",
			"Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest or long rest"

		"level": 6,
		"description": "At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid's persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or you finish a long rest.",
		"usage": [
			"You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you",
			"You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action",
			"While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance",
			"Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check",
			"Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can't capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest"

		"description": "At 14th level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature's deepest fears. As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn't share a language with you or if it can't hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.",
		"additionalDetails": [
			"If the target fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack or damage it",
			"It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret",
			"While you gain no knowledge of this secret, the target is convinced you know it",
			"While charmed in this way, the creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won't risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so",
			"It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend",
			"When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear",
			"Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest"
